JavaScript To-Do List is a repository that provides a simple and customizable to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The to-do list application allows users to add, delete, and mark items as complete or incomplete, as well as reorder items on the list.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the to-do list application. The HTML files include the basic structure for the to-do list and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the to-do list items and display. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for adding, deleting, and reordering items on the to-do list, as well as updating the list display.

Users can customize the to-do list by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
